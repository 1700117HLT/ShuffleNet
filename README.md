# ShuffleNet
This is caffe implementation of ShuffleNet, For details, please read the original paper:  
["ShuffleNet: An Extremely Efficient Convolutional
Neural Network for Mobile Devices" by Xiangyu Zhang et. al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01083.pdf).
This code is based on camel007's implementation(https://github.com/camel007/Caffe-ShuffleNet), but I recode the cuda file for acceleration.

# Deploy
I also finish a deploy file for ShuffleNet 1x group=3, please refer to it.
